	<h1>Packed Pierogi</h1>
	<p id="slogan">Handcrafted pierogi, with an American accent.</p>

	<p>We learned how to make our delicious pierogi the traditional way: from Mom and Grandma, in the kitchen, year after year, holiday after holiday. At every family celebration, pierogi are always on the menu.</p>
	<p>We use our family’s time-tested recipe for tender dough. We make each dumpling by hand, preserving the techniques that have endured for generations. And, we’ve added a bit of our own history along the way: crafting new, original flavors for your table.</p> 

	<p>At Packed Pierogi we’re preserving and creating history, one pierogi at a time.</p>
